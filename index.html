    <img src="The-general-diagram-of-the-real-time-joint-SoC-estimator.png" alt="Project Image">
    <p>Soc and Soh estimation of lithium ion battery
Developed a Kalman filter-based algorithm for accurate estimation of SOC(State of Charge) and SOH (State of Health) in lithium-ion batteries.
Implemented the algorithm to continuously monitor and assess the battery'scharge status and overall health. Discovering the Hidden Potential of Lithium-Ion Batteries with a Kalman FilterAlgorithm
Innovation in battery system methodology increased battery performance by25% through precise state of charge and health estimation.</p>
